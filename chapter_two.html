                    Once the man thought he would visit the godfather, and tell him how he had
                    succeeded with the water. But when he entered the house, the strangest
                    things were going on within. On the first flight of stairs, the broom and
                    shovel were disputing, and knocking each other about violently. He asked
                    them,
                    </p>
            
                    <blockquote>"where does the godfather live?"</blockquote>
            
                    <p>The broom replied,</p>
            
                    <blockquote>"one flight of stairs higher up."</blockquote>
            
                    <p>
                    When he came to the second flight, he saw a heap of dead fingers lying. He
                    asked,
                    </p>
            
                    <blockquote>"where does the godfather live."</blockquote>
            
                    <p>One of the fingers replied,</p>
            
                    <blockquote>"one flight of stairs higher."</blockquote>
            
                    <p>
                    On the third flight lay a heap of dead heads, which again directed him to
                    the flight beyond. On the fourth flight, he saw fishes on the fire, which
                    frizzled in pans and baked themselves. They, too, said, one flight of
                    stairs higher. And when he had ascended the fifth, he came to the door of
                    a room and peeped through the keyhole, and there he saw the godfather who
                    had a pair of long horns. When he opened the door and went in, the
                    godfather got into bed in a great hurry and covered himself up.
