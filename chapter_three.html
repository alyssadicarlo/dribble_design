                    <p>Then said the man,</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    "sir godfather, what a strange house-hold you have. When I came to your
                    first flight of stairs, the shovel and broom were quarreling, and beating
                    each other violently."
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>"How stupid you are,"</blockquote>

                    <p>said the godfather.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                    "That was the boy and the maid talking to each other."
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                    "But on the second flight I saw dead fingers lying."
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                    "Oh, how silly you are. Those were some roots of scorzonera."
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                    "On the third flight lay a heap of dead men's heads."
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"Foolish man, those were cabbages."</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                    "On the fourth flight I saw fishes in a pan, which were hissing and baking
                    themselves. When he had said that, the fishes came and served themselves
                    up. And when I got to the fifth flight, I peeped through the keyhole of a
                    door, and there, godfather, I saw you and you had long, long horns."
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"Oh, that is not true."</blockquote>

                    <p>
                    The man became alarmed, and ran out, and if he had not, who knows what the
                    godfather would have done to him.
