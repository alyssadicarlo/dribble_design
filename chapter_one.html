                    A poor man had so many children that he had already asked everyone in the
                    world to be godfather, and when still another child was born, no one else
                    was left whom he could invite. He knew not what to do, and, in his
                    perplexity, he lay down and fell asleep. Then he dreamt that he was to go
                    outside the gate, and ask the first person he met to be godfather. When he
                    awoke, he determined to obey his dream, and went outside the gate, and
                    asked the first person who came up to him to be godfather. The stranger
                    presented him with a little glass of water, and said,
                    </p>
            
                    <blockquote>
                    "this is a wonderful water, with it you can heal the sick, only you must
                    see where death is standing. If he is standing by the patient's head, give
                    the patient some of the water and he will be healed, but if death is
                    standing by his feet, all trouble will be in vain, for the sick man must
                    die."
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>
                    From this time forth, the man could always say whether a patient could be
                    saved or not, and became famous for his skill, and earned a great deal of
                    money. Once he was called in to the child of the king, and when he
                    entered, he saw death standing by the child's head and cured it with the
                    water, and he did the same a second time, but the third time death was
                    standing by its feet, and then he knew the child had to die.
